# Project HexMap

Welcome to the Project_HexMap wiki!

I'm a 7th Grader in Southern California (in the United States of America). Just working on this as a hobby, mostly to see if I can make up something that some of my friends might enjoy. However, I'm open to any ideas you might post (but I have no idea how you would post them; I'm new to github). Also feel free fork off of this project for your own personal projects. 

# Concept
* A Game that takes place on a hex-tile grid (thusly, I named it Project HexMap. But I'm open to better sounding and more creative names as well.)
* Some kind of resources acquired from each tile (similar to the board game Settlers of Catan)
* Some kind of village building (similar to banished)
* Maybe some kind of government management (similar to Urban Empires)
* Maybe an exploration component (like Civilization)
